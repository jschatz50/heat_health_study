# heat_health_study

includes:
-DLNMs (distributed lag non-linear models)
-INLA models (bayesian spatial and spatial-temporal)
-randomForest models (machine learning...essentially a monte carlo of decision-tree based regressions)
-raster sampling (calculates daily ATmax/min for zips or block groups.  i also used this to sample temperature by block group at 15-minutes intervals throughout study period, for calculating heat duration and thresholds)
