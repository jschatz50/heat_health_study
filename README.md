# heat_health_study

includes:
(1) DLNMs (distributed lag non-linear models)---(2) INLA models (bayesian spatial and spatial-temporal)---(3) randomForest models (essentially a monte carlo of decision-tree based regressions)---(4) raster sampling (calculates daily ATmax/min for zips or block groups.  i also used this to sample temperature by block group at 15-minutes intervals throughout study period, for calculating heat duration and thresholds)
